## PANEL: Experimental Approaches to Pedagogy Through Art and Literature ##

**Rendering reality: a speculative approach to the life-world of adolescent artists by Laura Barritt**

Umwelt as life-world -- understanding the differences of perceived reality of children and adolescents in navigating and world-building

* Applied to teaching art in grade school in UK
* Teachers are tought to evaluate art of children for "objective" skill/technique and quality of work
* Children perceive and create life-world quite differently than adults (ex. a knot in a tree may determine where to cut the tree down for wood for an adult. Same knot could appear as the face of a demon to child and frighten the child)

*Piaget* -- children usually use hand gestures to communicate and understand the world. Children are more sensory in their engagement with the world. Words are often not enough to understand the world/experience without support of other senses.

**Empathy Development in the L2 Literature Classroom by Tyler Gabbard-Rocha**

Empirical research showing that reading literature more effective for teaching communications than analyzing other communications genre like instructions manuals. Argued to help develop empathy and pro-social attitudes.

Uses English translations from Hispanic texts and asking them to build character profiles from them. Engages students to empathize with characters and speculate how they feel, who they are, what their experiences are, despite this information being nowhere in the text.

Also found that students improved Spanish through this exercise - learning outcome of the course

Empathy as dark - can be manipulated. Empathy as employment skill for late capitalism

Collecting data at beginning of semester and end of semester.

**Historical Pedagogies as New Radical Practice by Kelly Donahey**

Free Speech on campus - movements against administration

Students made to use IBM punchcards at UC Berkeley (1960s) -- students tracked through punchcards, enrolment data

* Students were pushed back and were censored
* Found more quick info here: ["Do not fold, spindle or mutilate":
A cultural history of the punch card](https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/pre/fsm.html)

*Quantified Student*

* iClickers
* Socratic
* Blackboard, D2L, Moodle
* Online management systems for student data

"Fear of public speaking (for students) trumps fear of Big Brother"

Calls these the educational equivalent of "clickbait" - not active learning, not thinking and doing or practice/praxis

* Cost has been a barrier to more effective forms of student learning - discussion based courses need to be smaller, need more space, more instructors, more time
* This "interactive" technologies promise to be more time-effective while raising their engagement and GPA - unfounded
* Also displaces cost onto the student to buy the technology -- iClicker about $30

## PANEL: Epistemic Subversion and Paranormal Practice ##

**Polyglot Speech from an Other Side by Sam Stoeltje**

ABSTRACT. Electronic Voice Phenomena, or EVP, refers to the anomalies or artifacts that appear in the background noise of an electronic recording. Throughout the twentieth century, the practice of combing noise for spectral signals became its own paranormal culture, even to the extent of skirting popular awareness in, for instance, the Hollywood horror film The Sixth Sense. This paper provides a brief overview of the history of EVP, with attention to its relation both to electronic media and mediations, and to alternative religious movements such as Spiritualism. The history is followed by specific theoretical attention to probably the most significant EVP text, paranormal researcher Konstantīns Raudive’s Breathrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead.

Breakthrough consists of transcriptions of recordings featuring questions addressed to the spirits, and Raudive’s interpretation of the subsequent EVP as responses. The responses take the form of a fusion of different (European) languages; that is, a heteroglossia. An EVP-skeptic would understand this as a tactic for broadening the criteria of what constitutes a “signal” in the noise; with more languages in play, a random artifact is more likely to be interpreted as a sense-making phoneme. Alternatively, an EVP-believer might understand the heteroglossia as a natural consequence of the post-human state of spirit consciousness, untethered from single language.

The paper will use these two perspectives on EVP as a point of departure for theoretical speculations on heteroglossia as an aesthetic and a politics; apophenia and pattern recognition with respect to the signal/noise distinction; and the metaphysical implications of a heteroglossic afterlife.


Raudive’s Breathrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead

Jürgenson - "Sprechfunk mit Verstorbenen" or "Voice Transmissions with the Deceased" -- EVP and the Necrophone - mechanical medium to "connect to the dead" - where the dead is acoustic noise

* EVP is the same technology you see used in those paranormal hunter reality shows.
* Follows a sort of Derridean *hauntology* treatment of electric "voice" in ambient sound recording
* Jürgenson himself actually (?) believed that these voices were first aliens, then decided they must be the voice of the deceased, telling Jürgenson about the afterlife
 
 How do the spirits talk to Jürgenson?
 
 * Calls it "polyglot" speech - "The most significant role is played by the influence of their dimension outside time and space, a sychronicity that affords the dead the great advantage of direct perception."
 * Jürgenson's phenomenology is informed by his conception of the "fourth dimension" - outside of space and time (inspired by Swedenborg, Christian *Pentecost*, (Acts) Tower of Babel.
 * Notably, Jürgenson's polyglot speech is Euro-centric
 
 *Julie's notes: How can we use the phenomenon of EVP to gain more information from a literary recording?
[Here's and app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ghost-recorder/id323051651) for "ghost recording" on your phone. Not sure if it actually uses EVP or not, but I'm going to check it out.*
