## PANEL: Experimental Approaches to Pedagogy Through Art and Literature ##

**Rendering reality: a speculative approach to the life-world of adolescent artists by Laura Barritt**

Umwelt as life-world -- understanding the differences of perceived reality of children and adolescents in navigating and world-building

* Applied to teaching art in grade school in UK
* Teachers are tought to evaluate art of children for "objective" skill/technique and quality of work
* Children perceive and create life-world quite differently than adults (ex. a knot in a tree may determine where to cut the tree down for wood for an adult. Same knot could appear as the face of a demon to child and frighten the child)

*Piaget* -- children usually use hand gestures to communicate and understand the world. Children are more sensory in their engagement with the world. Words are often not enough to understand the world/experience without support of other senses.

**Empathy Development in the L2 Literature Classroom by Tyler Gabbard-Rocha**

Empirical research showing that reading literature more effective for teaching communications than analyzing other communications genre like instructions manuals. Argued to help develop empathy and pro-social attitudes.

Uses English translations from Hispanic texts and asking them to build character profiles from them. Engages students to empathize with characters and speculate how they feel, who they are, what their experiences are, despite this information being nowhere in the text.

Also found that students improved Spanish through this exercise - learning outcome of the course

Empathy as dark - can be manipulated. Empathy as employment skill for late capitalism

Collecting data at beginning of semester and end of semester.

**Historical Pedagogies as New Radical Practice by Kelly Donahey**

Free Speech on campus - movements against administration

Students made to use IBM punchcards at UC Berkeley (1960s) -- students tracked through punchcards, enrolment data

* Students were pushed back and were censored
* Found more quick info here: ["Do not fold, spindle or mutilate":
A cultural history of the punch card](https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/pre/fsm.html)

*Quantified Student*

* iClickers
* Socratic
* Blackboard, D2L, Moodle
* Online management systems for student data

"Fear of public speaking (for students) trumps fear of Big Brother"

Calls these the educational equivalent of "clickbait" - not active learning, not thinking and doing or practice/praxis

* Cost has been a barrier to more effective forms of student learning - discussion based courses need to be smaller, need more space, more instructors, more time
* This "interactive" technologies promise to be more time-effective while raising their engagement and GPA - unfounded
* Also displaces cost onto the student to buy the technology -- iClicker about $30

## PANEL: Epistemic Subversion and Paranormal Practice ##

**Polyglot Speech from an Other Side by Sam Stoeltje**

ABSTRACT. Electronic Voice Phenomena, or EVP, refers to the anomalies or artifacts that appear in the background noise of an electronic recording. Throughout the twentieth century, the practice of combing noise for spectral signals became its own paranormal culture, even to the extent of skirting popular awareness in, for instance, the Hollywood horror film The Sixth Sense. This paper provides a brief overview of the history of EVP, with attention to its relation both to electronic media and mediations, and to alternative religious movements such as Spiritualism. The history is followed by specific theoretical attention to probably the most significant EVP text, paranormal researcher Konstantīns Raudive’s Breathrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead.

Breakthrough consists of transcriptions of recordings featuring questions addressed to the spirits, and Raudive’s interpretation of the subsequent EVP as responses. The responses take the form of a fusion of different (European) languages; that is, a heteroglossia. An EVP-skeptic would understand this as a tactic for broadening the criteria of what constitutes a “signal” in the noise; with more languages in play, a random artifact is more likely to be interpreted as a sense-making phoneme. Alternatively, an EVP-believer might understand the heteroglossia as a natural consequence of the post-human state of spirit consciousness, untethered from single language.

The paper will use these two perspectives on EVP as a point of departure for theoretical speculations on heteroglossia as an aesthetic and a politics; apophenia and pattern recognition with respect to the signal/noise distinction; and the metaphysical implications of a heteroglossic afterlife.


Raudive’s Breathrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead

Jürgenson - "Sprechfunk mit Verstorbenen" or "Voice Transmissions with the Deceased" -- EVP and the Necrophone - mechanical medium to "connect to the dead" - where the dead is acoustic noise

* EVP is the same technology you see used in those paranormal hunter reality shows.
* Follows a sort of Derridean *hauntology* treatment of electric "voice" in ambient sound recording
* Jürgenson himself actually (?) believed that these voices were first aliens, then decided they must be the voice of the deceased, telling Jürgenson about the afterlife
 
 How do the spirits talk to Jürgenson?
 
 * Calls it "polyglot" speech - "The most significant role is played by the influence of their dimension outside time and space, a sychronicity that affords the dead the great advantage of direct perception."
 * Jürgenson's phenomenology is informed by his conception of the "fourth dimension" - outside of space and time (inspired by Swedenborg, Christian *Pentecost*, (Acts) Tower of Babel.
 * Notably, Jürgenson's polyglot speech is Euro-centric
 
 *Julie's notes: How can we use the phenomenon of EVP to gain more information from a literary recording?
[Here's and app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ghost-recorder/id323051651) for "ghost recording" on your phone. Not sure if it actually uses EVP or not, but I'm going to check it out.*

## PANEL: Intersections of Sound and Culture ##

**Onomatopoeia, Sound Effects, and Experimental Disengagements of Late British Imperiality by Peter Bloom**

Onomatopoeia and sound effects - explanatory note in BBC archive for radio drama "A Comedy of Danger" Richard Hughes, 1924; broadcast on the BBC

Adorno - "radio voice"

1931 - BBC Yearbook specifies six different types of sound effects.

* Broadcasting house eigth floor designed to facilitate live recording of sound effects
* Big Ben recording becomes the strike of the hour radio sound effect - synonomous with a culture of precision and accuracy
* 1936 every radio broadcasting station affiliate of BBC were stocked with inventory of standard gramaphone sound effects
* Sound recordings featured many themes like: cityscape, war and battle, laughter, screams and sneezes, animals, etc.

**The micro-particles of the human voice”: science and technology in British sound and dub poetry by Suzanne Black**

Bob Cobbing [*Sockless in Sandals*](http://writing.upenn.edu/library/Cobbing-Bob_Sockless-in-Sandals_1985.pdf), p. 46 - concrete poetry

["Alphabet of Fishes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=xgzHQs0ZiFU&feature=emb_logo)

* Cobbing breaks down language into the "micro-particles" of human voice

Dub Poetry: affinities of spoken word and sound poetry - but more experimental in its form

**Pitch Shift: 432 Hz Music and the Promise of a Frequency by Ruth Rosenberg**

Lyndon LaRouche - advocated for musicians in Italy to no longer conform to international frequency of A=440 Hz

This conversation has resurged across the internet - possible resurgence was on the Prince fan page in 2014.

* Detractors critique this phenomenon to fringe movement, conspiracy, pseudo-scientific
* Ruth Rosenberg argues that the discourse around 432 movement can be equated to advocating "music self-care"
* Can cause vocal strain in upper register of a singer but different is nearly imperceptible to listeners
* Apps to convert entire music library to 432 exist

No unilateral justification for support of 432:
Historical claims of legitimacy - "All classical music used to be in 432"

* Tuning varied across Western countries from 1600-1880
* Some supporters of 432 Hz claim 440 HZ is a Nazi scientific propoganda as mind control because it promotes aggression

Other claims:

* Schumann Resonances - claim that earth's resonance is in 432 and resonates with our bodies better, grounding in "natural vibrations"

No amount of debunking can change how 432 Hz "feels" to "resonates" to its advocates. Dedicated listeners use adjectives that usually describe timbre to describe 432 and the musical effects on emotion and physical sensation:

* lighter
* deeper
* darker
* clearer
* softer
* calmer/coming
* improves quality of life
* feel in head, heart, gut, etc.

Conversion apps claim to "purify" and strip the file of undesirable sounds from 440. Rhetoric uses toxicity diction, *clean, pure, serene, "return"* and as an environment toxin.

**Transforming the Creative Practices of Composers and Sound Designers with VirDAW: the Virtual Reality Digital Audio Workstation by Theresa Jean Tanenbaum, Vincent Olivieri, Jovia Armstrong, Jack Bueermann, Yibo Gou, Luke Falcone, Jonathan Huang, Ittai Mann, Hunter Long, Yiwei Yu and Zhonglin Liu**

Presented by Theresa (Tess) Jean Tanenbaum, Vincent (Vinny) Olivieri

Looking at digital sound design software - interfaces are based off of analog sound engineering hardware - Skeuomorph

Asks: How does VR impact artistic practice? What are the unique properties of VR?

* VR is more immersive
* VR is more embodied
* VR is spatial

VR does not support fatigue from pointing, or finger control - thus, virtual (skeuomorphic) workstations need to be reimagined

VirDAW is built around new and old buttons and widgets - experimental and inductive to find the most accessible and immersive virtual environment for sound control/design workstations (first module).

Use Unity for front-end system, using the Max visual programming language as the audio backend, controlled via Open Sound Control (OSC).

VirDAW also reimagines control of reverb by putting it in an actual room (second module), rather than controlling levels of "dry-/wetness," for example.

"Kinetic Composition" (a third module) is used to control and hold sound through different parameters (e.g. Containers (surfaces, membranes, fields) and Triggers (e.g. pulses))

## PANEL: Meaning-making Practices in the Nonhuman ##

**Can Computers Create Meaning? A Bio-Cyber-Semiotic Perspective by Katherine Hayles**

“Meaning is made from actions and consequences“

Umwelt + biosemiotics (Hoffman derives his biosemiotics from Peircen triad)

The interprentant in the sign relation is significantly crucial to life forms
- extend to ALL biological forms despite presence of “brains”
- Sign relations are meaning making
- BUT biosemiotics fail to see computers as cognitive, Hayles says this is a biologism
- Computers are not autonomous but why is this a criteria for cognitive?
- Computers evolve through human-technical relations - computers have humans to be autonomous for them

Hayles proposes cybersemiosis rather than biosemiosis 

Anthropolcentricism of Searle’s Chinese Room is that he imagines human actor’s understanding of meaning and sense-making is the only important perspective.

What does the computer know?
- it can anticipate through infrastructure of logic gates and executable code
- Meaning making as consequence of anticipation

Planetary Cognitive Ecology = all the interconnected, assembled cognitions are networked

## PANEL: Theorizing Futurity: The Politics of the Speculative ##

**Bad Venture: Elizabeth Holmes and Venture Capital Futures by Sherryl Vint**

Focus on The Inventor/“Bad Blood”- movie on Elizabeth Holmes 

Speculative imagination as important tool for venture capital to tell stories of the visualization of the future

- Kaushik Sunder Rajan’s “venture science” and hype (aka lying, ex. Mira)
- “Forward-looking statements”
- Edison did this too, the focus on Holmes’ gender informs her treatment as a liar and that she never belonged in billionaire’s space

Theranos part of boutique medicine (genomics)

*Julie's notes: How is the narrative of consumer biohacking framed as Speculative Fiction?
