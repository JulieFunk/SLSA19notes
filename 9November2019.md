## PANEL: Experimental Approaches to Pedagogy Through Art and Literature ##

**Rendering reality: a speculative approach to the life-world of adolescent artists by Laura Barritt**

Umwelt as life-world -- understanding the differences of perceived reality of children and adolescents in navigating and world-building

* Applied to teaching art in grade school in UK
* Teachers are tought to evaluate art of children for "objective" skill/technique and quality of work
* Children perceive and create life-world quite differently than adults (ex. a knot in a tree may determine where to cut the tree down for wood for an adult. Same knot could appear as the face of a demon to child and frighten the child)

*Piaget* -- children usually use hand gestures to communicate and understand the world. Children are more sensory in their engagement with the world. Words are often not enough to understand the world/experience without support of other senses.

**Empathy Development in the L2 Literature Classroom by Tyler Gabbard-Rocha**

Empirical research showing that reading literature more effective for teaching communications than analyzing other communications genre like instructions manuals. Argued to help develop empathy and pro-social attitudes.

Uses English translations from Hispanic texts and asking them to build character profiles from them. Engages students to empathize with characters and speculate how they feel, who they are, what their experiences are, despite this information being nowhere in the text.

Also found that students improved Spanish through this exercise - learning outcome of the course

Empathy as dark - can be manipulated. Empathy as employment skill for late capitalism

Collecting data at beginning of semester and end of semester.

**Historical Pedagogies as New Radical Practice by Kelly Donahey**

Free Speech on campus - movements against administration

Students made to use IBM punchcards at UC Berkeley (1960s) -- students tracked through punchcards, enrolment data

* Students were pushed back and were censored
* Found more quick info here: ["Do not fold, spindle or mutilate":
A cultural history of the punch card](https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/pre/fsm.html)

*Quantified Student*

* iClickers
* Socratic
* Blackboard, D2L, Moodle
* Online management systems for student data

"Fear of public speaking (for students) trumps fear of Big Brother"

Calls these the educational equivalent of "clickbait" - not active learning, not thinking and doing or practice/praxis

* Cost has been a barrier to more effective forms of student learning - discussion based courses need to be smaller, need more space, more instructors, more time
* This "interactive" technologies promise to be more time-effective while raising their engagement and GPA - unfounded
* Also displaces cost onto the student to buy the technology -- iClicker about $30
