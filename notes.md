**WORKSHOP: Compost Devotional Ritual by Aja Rose Bond**

Aja wished we did not take pictures during the ritual.

*“Has anyone here ever seen a steaming hot ass heap of compost before?”*

She walked us through a ritual in which we grounded ourselves in ideas of life, death, and never-lived through ontologies of animism 

*  We discussed the ways that compost remediate the ecology

* Salmon are a huge part of the ecology of PNW . When salmon return to their birth places to spawn, bears eat them and their carcasses and the waste from the bears fertilize the forest floor. It’s one of the reasons why the red wood forests are so robust

* A tsp of garden soil can hold up to a billion microbes

After, we each participated in adding to the compost ritual by mixing from some of the materials Aja brought from her home in the Bay Area:
  
  * chicken shit
  * leaves
  * sticks
  * seaweed
  * bone meal
  * blood meal
  * charcoal
  * water
  * mother compost
  
  Aja will take the mixture back to her home compost so as to not introduce new microbiomes to Irvine.
  
Finally, we had a "harvest" debrief where we discussed the power of devotion in ritual and the ways that compost can ground us in our situatedness in ecology, humanity.
