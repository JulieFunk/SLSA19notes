## WORKSHOP: Compost Devotional Ritual by Aja Rose Bond ##

Aja wished we did not take pictures during the ritual.

*“Has anyone here ever seen a steaming hot ass heap of compost before?”*

She walked us through a ritual in which we grounded ourselves in ideas of life, death, and never-lived through ontologies of animism 

*  We discussed the ways that compost remediate the ecology

* Salmon are a huge part of the ecology of PNW . When salmon return to their birth places to spawn, bears eat them and their carcasses and the waste from the bears fertilize the forest floor. It’s one of the reasons why the red wood forests are so robust

* A tsp of garden soil can hold up to a billion microbes

After, we each participated in adding to the compost ritual by mixing from some of the materials Aja brought from her home in the Bay Area:
  
  * chicken shit
  * leaves
  * sticks
  * seaweed
  * bone meal
  * blood meal
  * charcoal
  * water
  * mother compost
  
  Aja will take the mixture back to her home compost so as to not introduce new microbiomes to Irvine.
  
Finally, we had a "harvest" debrief where we discussed the power of devotion in ritual and the ways that compost can ground us in our situatedness in ecology, humanity.

## PANEL: Experimental Engagements with Text ##

**Pincelate: Tools and Machine Learning Models for Sound Poetry by Allison Parrish**

ABSTRACT. Matching a word's sound to its spelling is more than just a set of rote grade school rules—it's a renewable source for creative expression. I present Pincelate: a system for producing expressive non-standard spellings of English words by "guiding" the probabilities of the decoding step in paired orthography-to-phonology and phonology-to-orthography sequence-to-sequence neural networks. Alongside a demonstration of the system's capabilities (automatic orthographically-constrained respellings; respelling with "hijacked" phonetics; phonetically-constrained nonsense word generation; "autozaumnification" with phonetic resizing) I offer a quantitative evaluation of the system's output with metrics of phonetic and orthography plausibility. I contextualize the tool both as a way to approach the operations of sound poetry in the poetic avant-garde and as a natural extension of my own work in this genre.

Project is machine learning model that spells and outputs words -

Looked at Lewis Carrol's "Jabberwocky" for examples of nonesense verse - we assign some conventional meaning to nonesense words in a way that allows us interpret and communicate non-vocabulary.

This is seen in the synesthesia of the [kiki/bouba effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect). Which shape is named kiki and which is named bouba?

 Allison also talked about [Zaumification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaum) as "transrational" ways of listening to sound.
 
 **Those red squiggly lines = misspelled?** They are SPELLED, there is no such thing as misspelled.
 
 
Pincelate: machine learning model for spelling and sounding out English-type words. It works through sequence to sequence (s2s) processing which takes grapheme (inputs) and applying phoneme vectors (nasal, rounded mouth, no ending) and outputting the new spellings as graphemes.

Some examples of what you can:
- denoise from garbble
- add noise to words = make garble
- add a "heb colb" (head cold)

Allison published a piece called "Compasses" made with pincelate in a chapbook.a
