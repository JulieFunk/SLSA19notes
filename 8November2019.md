 **An Athletic Laboratory: testosterone, data extraction, and consent in international track and field by Valerie Moyer**
 
Reviewing a, IAAF study on testosterone levels in female athletes in track and field, "Serum Androgen Levels" (2014). Asks what does it mean when the sports stadium becomes a laboratory?
 
 * stadiums are already social labs - podcast "burn it all down"
  * international athletes have been tested for hormonal/chromosomal levels 
  * targets black americans/POC - Tuskagee Syphillis Study
  * Policies make an athletes compliance for drug testing mandatory in order to compete - enforced by the IAAF refusal to comply is interpreted as covering up for cheating
  
 In this study, athletes were not informed about how the results would inform policy
 
 Coordination skills like spinning in the air (pole vault) get attributed to testosterone levels along with traditionally understood skills like strength and speed - this is contested by other biomedical research.
 
 Study found these running events and three track events were where testosterone levels mattered the most in female athletes:
 
 * 400m 
 * 800m
 
 These races were added to be covered by the policy, despite unsubstantiated by study:
 
 * 1500m
 * 1 mile 
 
 Argues this coverage intended to target specific black female athletes who compete in these races.

**"Make Your Body the Sexiest Outfit Youâ€™ll Ever Own:" Connected Fitness and Bodily Optimization" by Mikki Kressbach**

Looking at heartrate monitors in Orange Theory Fitness classes compared to Rate of Perceived Exercise Scale (RPE).

* RPE: Borg's Modified RPE Scale - tried to put perception of physical exertion on 10-pt scale which roughly maps on to % of max heart rate (e.g. 7 on scale is percieved as VERY HARD is roughly 70% of max heart rate).
* HIIT workouts focus on knowing how to accurately *perceive* exertion - this skill takes time to cultivate
* Orange Theory Fitness (OTF) uses heartrate monitors and colour-coding ranges to monitor "push" effort into new zones
* 1 = Base Zone, 2 = Push Zone, 3 = Sprint All Out
* Optimization and Efficiency saturate the language of HIIT and OTF
* Perception of the entirety of exercise is never captured in the OTF heartrate monitor
* Borg's RPE scale requires more embodied reflection of personal levels of physical exertion - conscious acknowledgement of sensation

OTF mediates this consciousness through the coloured ranges - focus on quanification and technological mediation - takes the self out of the sensation of exertion.

**The Hybridization of Mediated Exercise in the Digital Age by Katherine Contess**

Looks at new personal workout equipment that allows at-home live-stream of "group class" workouts

* Tonal
* Mirror
* Strava
* Peloton

Each device and set of coaches have their own performative personality (e.g. catch phrase - "You smashed it"). These devices also collect data on users in their home, and simulate a sense of sociality through monthly subscription for services.

Katherine traces a short history of at-home workout media throughout 20th C. (e.g. The Jack LaLanne show, Jane Fonda, Kayla Itsines). The technologies of fitness media/platforms determine who "fitness" is for:

* Mirror - LCD screen for workouts (recorded and live stream) when in use, a literal mirror when not in use - syncs with other devices (phone app, Apple Watch)
* Tonal - built with "dormant" sensors that are not in use currently, but are waiting to be developed, or "unlocked" as user's fitness levels increase

Foucault and the Gym: *Discipline and Punishment* Soldiering as habit-forming to produce a certain kind of "fit" subject - must understand the subject as "project." 

Neoliberalism in fitness technology takes this and mandates you must be mentally fit to be physically fit, consumer products - the "smarter the better" will allow one to achieve this.

**Cross-Border Interludes: experimental practices in socially-engaged environmental art by Maria Michails**

Looks at southeastern Saskatchewan crude oil industry compares to Albany, NY's petroleum storage area that runs through low-income, majority black neighbourhood. Trains and trucks running through neighbourhood produced emissions that made locals sick.

Southeastern SK as pastoral environment appears very different from urban Albany, but workers in mining and oil industries also suffer from disease caused by air pollution.

Citizen science - Louisiana Bucket Brigrade teaches citizens to measure air quality through non-expert field data collection. Citizen-led monitoring (emerges from DIY cultures) often has immediate readings (no lab work) and sooner incites political action.

*Projects:*

*Citizen-sensing rover project* -- decorated air monitors made with kids using an Arduino with cell shield and low cost dust sensors on RC vehicles in "Rover Walk"

* residents were primary source for informing local politicians which areas needed the most attention and what solutions would be best

*DIY Aerial Mapping* -- used balloons 

*Oral Histories* -- used to engage elders in the Indigenous community, residents of Albany, and residents of southeastern SK to gain insights on the changes to the rural landscape and land claims, effects crude oil trains and truck traffic. Measures peoples relation to the land.

**Experiments in Eco-poiesis: The Long-term Praxis of herman de vries by Wood Roberdeau**

Herman de vries - art understood as the full objectivation of receiving and producing in the anthropocene

"From Earth" works created from various material, organic deposits

**Forgetting and Remembering the Materiality of the Archives by Dani Stuchel**

TWITTER: [@plantarchives](https://twitter.com/plantarchives)

Plant Archives - Dani placed photograph in faux terra cotta planter with a prickly pear cactus to observe the decomposition of the photograph - chose an "impersonal" second-hand photo for experiment

* twice, after attempting to find the suitable spot to keep the planter, Dani moved it to a "better" spot upon reflection
* Dani forgot to attend to the plants, or to keep research notes despite having planned this experiment thoroughly

Looks at Freud's *forgetting* as an obscure motive to displace something unwanted

* *Irma Harrison* is a name transcribed on the back of the photo
* Dani found themself feeling personal connection to photograph, despite trying to choose a photo and design the experiment as "impersonal"

Dani attempted to use the decayed photograph to create a cyanotype (Oct. 2019)

Why destroy (or not) the photograph?

* destroying by entropy, environmental damage - builds personal relation and hopeful orientation to archival matter.

## PANEL: Critical Making and Executable Kits ##

**I Signify the Body Electric: Making Masculinity Through Media Technology by Jason Lajoie**

Critical muscle developer - developed by Jason Lajoie (support: Matt Frazer)

History of muscle developers in 20th C. --> use of electricity to develop muscles as part of masculinity and masculine embodiment (*On Electricity for the Muscles* William Bankier)

Bankier - the ideal physical culture of Bankier (AKA Apollo, The Scottish Hercules)

Notions of masculinity are understood through and mediated by our technologies 

* Electric belts - investigative tools for unlocking the secrets of "vitality"
* Electricity thought to be essential to vitality (Galvani, Shelley's *Frankenstein*)

Gendering of electricity -- women become the passive consumers of domestic electric appliance

Applied Media Theory - O'Gorman - critical objects to think with - scholarship of making media used to reflect/integrate new modes of theorizing that media

**Silkworms, Spindles, and the Strange Stranger by Helen J. Burgess**

Silkworms -- create ovum-shaped shelters out of silk and spittle
Stunt spindle -- takes animal hair, grass/leaves, and spit

*Helen gave us silk to pull and spin with our hands*

Object Oriented Ontology -- slow media, using spindle needle and thread to engage with objects and put them in relation with one another in reflective ways - different objects have different meanings in their rhetorical situatedness

Embroidery - the front: aesthetics, the back: patterns of economy of thread

*Julie's notes: I'm very interested in Helen's work on silk and silkworms in relation to silk's role in the IUD, and Derrida's observation/contemplation of the silkworm in "The Animal that I Therefore Am."*

**Now: A Kit for Digital Mindfulness by Roger Whitson**

*we practice 10-minute meditation*

Mindfulness as Buddhism in Modernity (e.g. apps like Headspace, 10% Happier podcast) - Ann Gleig critiques these treat Buddhism as scientific and open to use and interpretation, and neoliberal consumption - colonial work

**Basket Weaving as Media Theory by Marcel O'Gorman**

Book - Making Media Theory

Rabbit with basket hutch - the rabbit chews a hole in the hutch to better access food and water dish - O'Gorman begins to see rabbit as a maker

Looking at humans as bipedal/technological creatures - homo erectus

* Tim Ingold - challenges the *homo erectus* - image of Ingold's students making baskets on a beach near Aberdeen
* Students are crouched and continue to weave until they run out of fibre or are exhausted - practice of endurance
* Taking a step back from the exteriorization of the appendage/inclination towards the tool as prostheses

Containers are something made and used in domestic spaces - feminine spaces

*Touch* by Laura U. Marks - haptics as erotics that offer ways of engaging with objects through sense/sensuality

*The Queer Art of Failure* by Judith Halberstam - O'Gorman's "Crapentry"

* Basket making - to create space for discourse about the act of making and making containers
* The baskets were made at a week-long critical-making workshop at University of Guelph (DHatGuelph)
* The baskets ended up becoming waste baskets of all
