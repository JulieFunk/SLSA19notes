 **An Athletic Laboratory: testosterone, data extraction, and consent in international track and field by Valerie Moyer**
 
Reviewing a, IAAF study on testosterone levels in female athletes in track and field, "Serum Androgen Levels" (2014). Asks what does it mean when the sports stadium becomes a laboratory?
 
 * stadiums are already social labs - podcast "burn it all down"
  * international athletes have been tested for hormonal/chromosomal levels 
  * targets black americans/POC - Tuskagee Syphillis Study
  * Policies make an athletes compliance for drug testing mandatory in order to compete - enforced by the IAAF refusal to comply is interpreted as covering up for cheating
  
 In this study, athletes were not informed about how the results would inform policy
 
 Coordination skills like spinning in the air (pole vault) get attributed to testosterone levels along with traditionally understood skills like strength and speed - this is contested by other biomedical research.
 
 Study found these running events and three track events were where testosterone levels mattered the most in female athletes:
 
 * 400m 
 * 800m
 
 These races were added to be covered by the policy, despite unsubstantiated by study:
 
 * 1500m
 * 1 mile 
 
 Argues this coverage intended to target specific black female athletes who compete in these races.

**"Make Your Body the Sexiest Outfit Youâ€™ll Ever Own:" Connected Fitness and Bodily Optimization" by Mikki Kressbach**

Looking at heartrate monitors in Orange Theory Fitness classes compared to Rate of Perceived Exercise Scale (RPE).

* RPE: Borg's Modified RPE Scale - tried to put perception of physical exertion on 10-pt scale which roughly maps on to % of max heart rate (e.g. 7 on scale is percieved as VERY HARD is roughly 70% of max heart rate).
* HIIT workouts focus on knowing how to accurately *perceive* exertion - this skill takes time to cultivate
* Orange Theory Fitness (OTF) uses heartrate monitors and colour-coding ranges to monitor "push" effort into new zones
* 1 = Base Zone, 2 = Push Zone, 3 = Sprint All Out
* Optimization and Efficiency saturate the language of HIIT and OTF
* Perception of the entirety of exercise is never captured in the OTF heartrate monitor
* Borg's RPE scale requires more embodied reflection of personal levels of physical exertion - conscious acknowledgement of sensation

OTF mediates this consciousness through the coloured ranges - focus on quanification and technological mediation - takes the self out of the sensation of exertion.

**The Hybridization of Mediated Exercise in the Digital Age by Katherine Contess**

Looks at new personal workout equipment that allows at-home live-stream of "group class" workouts

* Tonal
* Mirror
* Strava
* Peloton

Each device and set of coaches have their own performative personality (e.g. catch phrase - "You smashed it"). These devices also collect data on users in their home, and simulate a sense of sociality through monthly subscription for services.

Katherine traces a short history of at-home workout media throughout 20th C. (e.g. The Jack LaLanne show, Jane Fonda, Kayla Itsines). The technologies of fitness media/platforms determine who "fitness" is for:

* Mirror - LCD screen for workouts (recorded and live stream) when in use, a literal mirror when not in use - syncs with other devices (phone app, Apple Watch)
* Tonal - built with "dormant" sensors that are not in use currently, but are waiting to be developed, or "unlocked" as user's fitness levels increase

Foucault and the Gym: *Discipline and Punishment* Soldiering as habit-forming to produce a certain kind of "fit" subject - must understand the subject as "project." 

Neoliberalism in fitness technology takes this and mandates you must be mentally fit to be physically fit, consumer products - the "smarter the better" will allow one to achieve this.
